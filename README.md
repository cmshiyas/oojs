## How do we create an object in JavaScript that inherits from another object?

We create a Teacher class, which inherits all the members from Person, but also includes:
1. A new property, subject — this will contain the subject the teacher teaches.
2. An updated greeting() method, which sounds a bit more formal than the standard greeting() method — more suitable for a teacher addressing some students at school.


Prototypes and inheritance represent some of the most complex aspects of JavaScript, but a lot of JavaScript's power and flexibility comes from its object structure and inheritance, and it is worth understanding how it works.
